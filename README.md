# Population analysis
Here we present the code related to the manuscript 
"Dynamics and maintainance of categorical responses in primary auditory cortex during task-engagement"
The script 'tutorial_run.m' shows how to perform the population analysis (both classifiers and linear regression) using chronic recordings from ferret primary auditory cortical responses. To use it, you need the population data set from our paper ‘Dynamics and maintainance of categorical responses in primary auditory cortex during task-engagement’ by Chillale et al., 2023. The data can be provided on a reasonable requet from the authors. In the following, I explain how to reproduce some of the figures from the paper.
